* look for good device details keys (like in UPnP spec?)
* find a way to publish the keys used in the devicedetails lookup table

* If daemon crashes/gets killed, on restart it might emit devices again as new
Should clients be aware of that?
Could there be a log (devicesAddedToBeEmitted) so on restart current state for clients is known?
But what if cleanup fails after emitting?
Perhaps better to tell the clients "Got a problem, here is current list of known devices", again with signal (by finding a lock file or similar)

* shutdown time should be configurable by config file

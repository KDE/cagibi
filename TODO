For 0.2:
* shutdown really needed in D-Bus api? usecase (besides development)?

For some future version:
* add log file
* react on available networks (e.g. proxy to NetworkManager)
  or should init/serviced do this? how to broadcast just on new network?
* proper behaviour on reconnection:
  (is there a way to discover the network is the same? even with same subnetwork adress could be a different one, so needs to query again, unless there is a proper way)
* browser tool which lists current cache
* restrict the networks listened on
* restrict the type of devices which is listened for (whitelist/blacklist)
* option to reparse config while running? triggered on D-Bus? on setting file(s) touched?
* add support for broadcasting, both dynamically as by installed files

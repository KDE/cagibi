Cagibi
======

This is an experimental cache/proxy system for the
SSDP* (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) part of UPnP.

Please contact the author Friedrich W. H. Kossebau <kossebau@kde.org>
for any further questions. Cooperation in this area is welcome :)


Purpose
-------
Cagibi aims to be to SSDP what Avahi is to DNS-SD/Zeroconf:
a cache caching all service/device announcements on the network in a local process
as well as being a broker serving local announcements to the network.
Both should be done by a single daemon process, accessable via D-Bus on the system bus.

The cache should offer active queries, so another process is only informed about changes
about UPnP devices it is interested in.

Building
--------
The buildsystem is based on cmake, please read the cmake documentation if you
are unfamiliar with it.
There are currently two parameters you can overwrite on configuring,
CAGIBI_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN_SECS and CAGIBI_DAEMON_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECS. Look into
CMakeLists.txt in the toplevel dir for more information about these.
